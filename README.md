**Job Category Prediction **



**Problem Statement**
Developed a machine learning model to predict the job category based on job descriptions. Given a dataset containing job descriptions from various industries, the goal is to build a model that accurately classifies new job descriptions into predefined categories such as marketing, engineering, healthcare, finance, etc.
In today's job market, there is a vast array of job opportunities spanning across different industries and domains. Employers often receive numerous job applications with varying job descriptions, making it challenging to manually categorize and process them efficiently. The task at hand is to automate this process using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset of labeled job descriptions, the objective is to train a model that can learn patterns and features from the text data and make accurate predictions about the job category for new, unseen job descriptions.
The machine learning model needs to be trained on this dataset to learn the relationship between the textual features of job descriptions and their respective categories. The trained model should then be capable of generalizing to new job descriptions and correctly classify them into the appropriate categories. The success of the model will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to ensure that it can effectively categorize job descriptions across different domains. Additionally, the model should be robust enough to handle variations in job descriptions and accurately classify them even in the presence of noise or ambiguity.
Overall, the aim of this project is to develop a reliable and scalable solution that can streamline the job categorization process for recruiters, HR departments, and job seekers alike, ultimately improving efficiency and reducing manual effort in job application processing.




**Solution**

The Decision Tree classifier is a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification tasks. In this implementation, the classifier is trained on a dataset containing job postings with attributes such as location, job type, workplace, and department. The goal is to predict the category of each job posting, which represents the domain or field of the job role.
Model Analysis:
• The Decision Tree classifier achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting job categories based on the provided attributes. The accuracy score indicates the overall performance of the model in classifying job postings into their respective categories.
• The classification report offers a more detailed evaluation of the model's performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for each job category. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly 
classify job postings across different categories.
• The decision tree model's interpretability allows for understanding of the decision-making process behind category predictions, as it creates a tree-like structure where each node represents a decision based on a specific feature.Overall, the Decision Tree classifier serves as a useful tool for predicting job categories based on job attributes, offering transparency and interpretability in the classification process.
